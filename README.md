# Monsanto Engineering Blog

## Function

This is the engineering blog of Monsanto engineers, where weâ€™ll share
ideas we have, open source software we use and have created. Watch
this space for future articles.

## New Posts

To contribute a new post, Monsanto engineers should fork the
`engineering-blog` repo, clone the fork, create a branch from develop,
create your new post in the `_posts` directory, check it in, push it,
create a [pull request][PR] from your new branch into develop on the
main version. After the PR is submitted it will go through the
approval process. Thanks

[PR]: https://github.com/MonsantoCo/engineering-blog/pulls (Monsanto Engineering Blog Pull Requests)

## Usage and development

*   Our engineering blog is built by [Jekyll][], so to work on it first
    install Jekyll. *If* you already have [Ruby][] and [RubyGems][]
    installed, this could be as easy as

        gem install jekyll --version '2.5.3'

    If you need to install those first, check out the
    [install documentation for Jekyll][jekyll-install].  You may also
    want to look at [rbenv][].

*   Fork the https://github.com/MonsantoCo/engineering-blog project
    using the Fork button in the top-right corner of its web page.

*   Next, checkout your fork of the site code

        git clone git@github.com:YOUR_USER/engineering-blog.git

    replacing `YOUR_USER` with your GitHub user name.

*   Change into the downloaded repository

        cd engineering-blog

*   **Create a new post**

    Copy one of the exsting posts, and make some changes.

        cp _posts/2015-01-22-stoop-our-first-open-source-release.md _posts/2015-04-01-this-is-a-new-post.md
        vi _posts/2015-04-01-this-is-a-new-post.md

    Again, be sure to update the 'frontmatter', that's the code
    between the `---` marks. Their functions are
    self-explanitory. After that build the site with Jekyll (see
    below) to see how it looks.

*   **Create a new page**

    If you're starting with html copy one of the exsting pages, for
    example `about.html` and make some changes

        cp about.html new_page.html
        vi new_page.html

    Be sure to update the 'frontmatter', that's the code between the
    `---` marks. Their functions are self-explanitory. After that
    build the site with Jekyll (see below) to see how it looks.

*   Build and server the site with Jekyll

        jekyll s

    Then you can view the site point your browser to
    http://localhost:4000/

*   Once you are done editing, add, commit and push the changes to GitHub

        git add .
        git commit -m "This is what I did to the code"
        git push

*   Finally, go to the web page for your repo and create a pull request
    into the develop branch of the MonsantoCo/engineering-blog.  Once
    submitted your PR will be reviewed and posted publicly.

## Push to production

You can just use the `update_prod.sh` script.

    bash update_prod.sh

You will get an email warning you about the CNAME setting for the site
that you can safely ignore.

Reload the site in a browser and enjoy!
